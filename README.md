# EOQ Search Reranker Browser Extension

A Chrome browser extension that intercepts Google search results and re-ranks them based on the Existence Optimization Quotient (EOQ) framework, prioritizing content that promotes human flourishing over engagement metrics.

## üåü What is EOQ?

The Existence Optimization Quotient (EOQ) evaluates content across four key dimensions:

- **Empathy Contribution (40%)**: How well content considers collective benefit and wellbeing

- Domain reputation assessment
- Language pattern recognition

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Extension Not Working
- Ensure you're on a Google search results page (`google.com/search`)
- Check that the extension is enabled in `chrome://extensions/`
- Try refreshing the page or restarting Chrome

#### No Scores Appearing
- Verify your OpenAI API key is valid and has credits
- Check the browser console for error messages
- Try enabling heuristic scoring in settings

#### Scores Seem Incorrect
- Remember that EOQ measures human flourishing, not traditional relevance
- AI scoring can be subjective and may vary
- Try clearing the cache and recalculating scores

#### Performance Issues
- Enable score caching to reduce API calls
- Consider using heuristic scoring for faster results
- Check your internet connection for API-based scoring

### Debug Mode
Access debug information in the browser console:
```javascript
// View current scores
window.EOQDebug.getScores()

// Get reordering statistics
window.EOQDebug.getStats()

// Reprocess current results
window.EOQDebug.reprocess()

// Clean up extension
window.EOQDebug.cleanup()
```
